# Abstract of the Project:
        
       # Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation    of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. 
         
       #  Cryptocurrencies are often volatile, which means their prices can fluctuate wildly due to users. Even though they are volatile in nature, one can visualize        prices and other statistical factors which helps the investors to decide on digital trading they want to spend their earnings on. Exploratory Data Analysis of            cryptocurrencies data and perform time series forecasting.
         
        # To forecast digital value for various currencies by considering several variables data, such as open price, close price, low price, high price, market            capitalization, and volume from Crypto watch API. 

        # Active long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are applied on an individual data set of 20 Cryptocurrencies namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple, Tether,      AAVE, Algorand, Ftxtoken, Polygon, USD coin, SHIBA INU, Fantom, UMA, DOGE, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Graph to observe testing result of      the analysis. 

        # Project aims to improve forecasting of Cryptocurrency price value variations and suggesting whether on a particular day a cryptocurrency can be sell or buy        with atmost accuracy.

# Web Scrapping

    # Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. 

    # When a web scraper needs to scrape a site, first the URLs are provided. Then it loads all the HTML code for those sites and a more advanced scraper might even         extract all the CSS and Javascript elements as well. Then the scraper obtains the required data from this HTML code and outputs this data in the format specified       by the user. 

    # Mostly, this is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file, but the data can also be saved in other formats, such as a JSON file.

    # Many large websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format.

    # Three basic principles:
    
	    		Step 1: Making an HTTP request to a server
		    	Step 2: Extracting and parsing (or breaking down) the website’s code
 		    	Step 3: Saving the relevant data locally

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Step 1:     Data Collection (Merge entire data sets into one csv)

Step 2:     Data Cleaning (Identify necessary attributes )

Step 3:     Multivariant analysis of cryptocurrency attributes.

Step 4:     Data Visuliazation ( Insights will be represented graphically by using 	plotly library to get interactive interface).


# Time Series Forecasting

      # Time Series Analysis comprises of techniques for analyzing Time Series data in an attempt to extract useful statistics and identify characteristics of the             data. 
      # Time Series Forecasting is the use of a mathematical model to predict future values based on previously observed values in the Time Series data.

      # A  Time Series Forecasting task involves five basic steps :
      
              Step 1: 	Problem definition.
              Step 2: 	Gathering information.
              Step 3: 	Preliminary (exploratory) analysis.
              Step 4: 	Choosing and fitting models (LSTM)
              Step 5: 	Using and evaluating a forecasting model.

      # There are many statistical techniques available for time series forecast however  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network ability to handle complex non            linear pattern.
      
# Conclusion

    # The purpose of cryptocurrency suggestions is to have a clear understanding of price variations as per time stamp and have an idea of future predictions to invest       and accuracy of the model is around 96%. Even the relation between each cryptocurrency is based on different price attributes.

    # Many previous studies had issues due to static data sets and several inaccurate predictions were effectively deleted from the model since the set of data. 

    # A range of uncertainty attribute values influences the prediction of future investments by considering only LSTM. However, we are not able to anticipate the           price accurately due to various factors and future research impacts more accurate results.

    # Based on avaliable data attributes, we get atmost results based on those values, we suggesting whether to buy or sell a particular cryptocurrency.
